## v0.5

Big update!

- Custom API Added: A custom API for Metroflip has been introduced for smoother operation and better scalability.
- Parsers Moved to Plugins: All parsers have been moved to individual plugins, which means all parser-related code is now loaded from the SD card as .fal files, freeing up RAM until a parser is needed.
- Scene Optimization: All separate scenes have been merged into one unified scene (metroflip_scene_parse.c), simplifying the codebase.
- RAM Usage Reduced: Weâ€™ve reduced RAM usage by over 45%, eliminating those frustrating "out of memory" errors.
- Navigo Station List: The Navigo station list has been relocated to apps_assets, improving organization and performance.
- Unified Calypso Parser: A new unified Calypso parser has been introduced (thanks to DocSystem), streamlining Calypso card support.
- RavKav Moved to Calypso Parser: RavKav has been moved to the new unified Calypso parser (credit to luu176).
